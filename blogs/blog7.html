                        <p>The coronavirus pandemic unleashed extraordinary ways of life on every person on this globe. With an entirely new disease unheard of, came a string of unpredictable events that disrupted every activity of human civilization till date; barely an aspect untouched by the pandemic waves. With so much happening at a quick pace, the world outside the human body came to a sudden standstill. But the human mind did not. It began witnessing an assortment of complex emotions- both existent and emerging. These were inescapable states of mind making no person exceptions to mental health imbalances.</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Realising the Value</p>
                        <p>Mental health is a matter of paramount significance. This subject in human health discourses has often been on the underestimated, neglected and ignorant side where people forget to take care of the very engine that drives the body to any movement. Everything that we as human beings experience in our day to day lives has an influence- negatively as well as positively on our cognitive processes and functions. This hub of masterly operations takes responsibility for receiving, extracting, deciphering and responding to every stimulus the body is exposed to. The brain engineers the mind, controlling the body, which is otherwise mere skin. When vital cognitions fail, the mind goes astray followed by mental breakdowns and malfunctions, causing the body to behave in the most bizarre and dangerous ways. Yet, the importance of mental health is meagre.<br><br>
                          People are always keen on doing the maximum and spending the best on everything that keeps their bodies distant from diseases and deficiencies; ensuring hygienic environments for cooking, eating and storing, maintaining clean homes and surroundings, and going the extra mile on additional intake of nutritional supplements separately. But for the health-supporting mentally, the pivot of all bodily functions, the count stands at little to nothing.</p>

                        <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Mental Health and Pandemic: Hand in Hand</p>  
                        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has paved paths for infinite problems. The world is in shock and suffering. Humans are not only contracting the coronavirus but have also found themselves in fear, anxiety, stress, trauma, disorders and depression. For people who test positive with the contagion, dreadful times burden them in hospitals. Whereas, people staying at home are strained with new realities like total confinement, work from home, online classes and harsh ones like cuts in salaries, job losses and dropouts. Also, not leaving out fake news, rumours and excessive exaggerations being circulated through various media. All these are new and difficult adaptations. Thus, both physical and mental exhaustion prevail. Every person, if not infected by the virus, have experienced mental issues at some point or the other, as life sets adrift from normalcy.<br><br>
                          Circumstances as such make people aware, acknowledge and assess their mental health state. It is evident how a physical ailment can emanate other ailments as well. Mental health is sensitive and fragile to stimuli propelling negative emotions, just like the physical body is acute to pathogens. Numerous courses, webinars, workshops and therapies related to mental healthcare are being organized more than ever before. For decades, the prevalence of mental health conditions has been broadly unchanged; this trend changed in 2020 with the outbreak of
 
                          the Covid-19 pandemic (2020, OECD). Hence, a genuine demand for mental health resources is at rise as people struggle every day.
                          </p>
                          <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Through the Lens of Age</p>
                          <p>As days passed and lockdowns extended, staying at home became more troublesome. Different age groups experienced different issues to cope with. They are still being confronted in the present day.<br><br>
                            At an age when children should be full of energy, socially active and spirited, they appear withdrawn. Children are now locked in their homes due to school closures having very little room for interaction with their fellow friends. Physical activities are compromised. As a result, they are experiencing loneliness, lack of companionship, boredom, irritation and sadness. During such times, they also fear separation from their parents and loved ones on whom they depend entirely. Children have become restless due to lack of outdoor activities and interactions which they were always accustomed to. In a report, findings reveal that children have felt uncertainty, isolation, poor appetite, agitation, inattention and separation-related anxiety. (2020, PubMed)<br><br>
                            Adolescents are facing frequent and enormous emotional instability during the pandemic. Already in an age group, where they pass from numerous physical, hormonal and emotional transitions, the pandemic exerts greater changes on them. Many important settings like classrooms, seminars, competitions and other gatherings have gone virtual. The role of social media platforms is now even more prominent. Young teenagers are burdened with daily flushes of information, academic routines, social isolation, extra-curricular courses followed by mood and eating disorders, panic attacks, persistent stress of a busier life existing virtually, anxiety over balancing every task as a student, inferiority complexes from social media platforms depicting perfection and others. Students have also been anxious over the cancellation of examinations and other disruptions in their educational fields (2020, PubMed). Number of cases with depression, disorders and suicides have shot up. The mental health of adolescents is seriously severed accruing to all the newness.<br><br>
                            The mental health status has also taken an unhealthy leap for adults. They are the victims of unemployment and pay cuts. Adults who have lost their jobs are going through heavy mental stress. They are in a very tough position due to financial insecurity which has affected them and also their families. A report by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) has proved that people who lost their jobs during the pandemic reported greater incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders than those who still had their jobs. Others who are fortunate to retain their jobs with certain pay cuts have been introduced to ‘work from home’. While these have been convenient from home desks, they are also challenging because the division of workplace and household tasks are now converged. Spending hours in front of screens and also making sure household chores are properly done simultaneously creates a pressure of balance between the two. Mostly, women have endured the brunt of this challenge, both working and non-working.<br><br>
                            The last age group which has also faced mental health issues are the elderly people. Senior citizens have also suffered from the inability to step outside. At such ages of physical and mental weakness, new rules and health protocols are difficult to process and follow. They depend majorly on external support and require communication. The pandemic has disturbed their social connections with selected family members and friends due to lack of physical contact, they worry about their existing health problems, their medications and treatments along with increased fears of illness and death. Such a period has made them more vulnerable to helplessness.

                          <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">The Warriors and Grievers</p>

                          <p>It will be unfair to sideline the mental health conditions of frontline workers who are ensuring the safety of every person, people who are infected with the virus and families of the covid infected patients. Doctors, nurses, medical associates and healthcare workers are drained physically and mentally because of their uninterrupted pursuit of duty. Many have even lost their lives due to the virus, overwork and absence of proper rest. Patients of Covid-19 continuously worry over their speedy recovery. Their families also go through the mental distress of fear and anxiety.</p>
                          <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Prioritizing Mental Health</p>

                          <p>Before the global disease struck, only a section of people prioritized their mental health. Mental health centres, helplines and related assistance operated minimally in countries. Instances of underfunding and zero funding of these provisions were also prominent. With the advent of the virus, these loopholes widened. Although the demand for mental health services expanded, their initial availability and accessibility were not enough. Only with time, has mental health support increased at an impressive pace. During this health crisis, people should indulge in healthy habits that build self-realisation and stay away from any information or habits harming their positive energies and beliefs. Focus should be on the good of oneself as well as others. If professional psychological intervention is required, one must not hesitate to get help. The gravity of mental illnesses and their effects needs to be emphasised. They are not simple or silly. They are indeed as serious as any other physical problem. In light of the pandemic, governments can also play their part in spreading mental health awareness. Just like mandatory basic covid protocols are imparted through various media and communication networks, the same can be done for accentuating mental health advices and details. Thus, dealing with mental wellness as eagerly as with physical. This can produce substantial impacts in a positive direction.</p>
                        
                          <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Summing up</p>
                          <p>The essence of achieving a healthy body will be complete only if one equally prioritises mental and physical health components. All research, findings and practical experiences support the affirmation and adoption mental health awareness. The pandemic is an eye-opener to stereotypes, stigmas and taboos related to mental health. Let us be wise in disseminating the term health in ‘Health is Wealth’. One who embraces good health, nurtures both body and mind.</p>

                      <p>Here’s a quick story of my father battling Covid, before I begin talking about Mental Health. I do not know how short it’s gonna be, but I’m gonna keep it as crisp as possible.</p>
                      <p>On 10th Oct, 2020 my father was tested positive for Covid-19. It wasn’t as severe as we have seen others suffer so we decided to keep him in isolation in our guest room. As my mother is a Nurse who actively worked on and off on many covid cases, she knew all the procedures required to make anyone feel better. And at that time the vaccines weren't ready yet, so hospitals used the usual medicines for treatment. My father is a very stubborn person by nature, he didn’t want to stay in the hospital ward. So we all collectively decided to keep him home, isolated. Also home quarantine was something many infected people opted for. After a couple of days his body temperature started rising, we fed him the medicines as prescribed and even injected a bottle of saline at midnight at home. On the very next day, his health started deteriorating. We immediately rushed him to the hospital where my mother works, Central Hospital Maligaon, Guwahati. Fortunately due to having connections with the senior doctors at the hospital my father was immediately rushed to the ICU. He was under observation for 24
 
                        hours. But the next day one of the doctors who was working in Covid Ward referred my father to GNRC Medical, Amingaon. Stating that it will be quite risky to keep him here for long.
                        </p>

                    <p>I was there with my mother when he was being shifted to a different hospital. We immediately rushed him to GNRC, in an ambulance. It was my first time stepping inside an ambulance. It’s frightening and scary. My father sat right in front of me with an oxygen mask up on his face. At that moment inside the ambulance I heard nothing but the siren of the ambulance. When the ambulance rushes through chaotic and busy streets, the eyes of pedestrians are on you. I do not remember how I felt at that moment or did I even feel anything? My brain blocked all the emotions and tapped out only the adrenaline. I carried all the essentials and documentation required for the admission with me all the time. I was making calls to my relatives and father’s colleagues, informing them about us being at the hospital. After all the hassle he was finally shifted inside and his treatment began. My body began to ache, I was tired and drenched in sweat. As we had to walk up and down to the 5th floor several times.</p>   
                    <p>One of my aunts called me, when I received the call; I wasn’t able to even utter a single word. I immediately passed my phone to my mother and let her do the talking. Until then I was so busy in fulfilling all the necessities of the hospital required to begin the treatment, I didn't knew what would happen if something went wrong. Suddenly my mind hit me with the thought of living a life ahead without a father. And that’s when the first tear rolled down my cheeks. It took me a


                      while to calm myself down. After a couple of hours one of my cousins showed up at the hospital to be there with us.
                      
                      
                      My mother and cousin decided to stay overnight at the hospital. I returned back home. I freshened myself and immediately laid down on my bed. The relief, stress and tiredness flooded inside, disappeared. After many days of treatment he was tested negative, but they didn’t discharge him for another 3 days. Then he returned home after triumphing covid. It’s been almost 8 months and he is making progress to normal after suffering from post covid complications.

                      <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">My thoughts on Mental Health during Pandemic</p> 

                      <p>Waking up in total oblivion isn’t a possibility anymore. We’re flooded by the evil tidings. My mind takes endless runs trying to scream and escape the chaos inside. We are all drowning into the ocean of loss, grief and despair. Unable to fathom the grasp of the situation. The stigma of anxiety and apprehension has always been a part throughout my whole childhood. And during this time of crisis, the levels have only peaked. Failing to express myself from
 
                        beneath got nothing but vague acknowledgement from others. To the point where I start questioning my own sanity, doubting my beliefs and trying to make sense from the most nonsensical occurrences in the surroundings.
                        </p>

                        <p>We all lost someone; a guardian, a friend, a neighbour and an acquaintance. Witnessing them turn cold in front of our eyes rushed an immense amount of emotions and feelings inside us. To the point where due to the extremely hectic arrangement of cremation or burying, we couldn’t even bid a farewell to them or get a glance through their lifeless faces. Due to the constraints and orders from the authorities, it is quite burdensome to meet someone physically. Especially in these times when you need a shoulder to cry upon, a hug to loose upon and a hand to hold on.</p>

                        <p>Who do we blame for the loss? What could I’ve done? How long will I need to bear this?These are some of the questions that I've been trying to find answers to. Little did I know, chasing the retort gave nothing but more anger, more instability and insaneness. Living within the four walls for so long, craving for human interaction, suffocating in the chaos, unable to cope with loss and grief made me impatient and restless. I avoided any human contact physically and mentally. The endless scrolling of aimless social media consumed the little leftover inside me.<br><br>
                          Fortunately, due to the existence of few people in my life. It wasn't as tough for me as others. As I do not seek any answers anymore. I want someone to just listen and give me the genuine and worthy validation that I want. Before soliciting solutions, the questions need to be addressed first in any circumstances. Writing has immensely helped me to declutter my mind and understand my thought process. This year I started blogging. And I can proudly say that I made some progress, it’s definitely minimal. But, I made it till here. I would like to shamelessly share a few of my small achievements. Published one of my articles on The Assam Tribune and even participated in a writing competition organised by VIT. Now, I have realized; life is a sequence of parables. At one point you’ll be at the deepest trench but the future definitely seems golden. So, just hang on.</p>

                    <p>Mental health – a topic which does not get talked about as often as is needed these days. This concept is still vague for a lot of people even in 2021, an illness because of which people are taking their own lives. The reason for this may be because of the deep rooted stigma of the society that our mental health is not as important as our physical health; seeing is believing, what people cannot see, they tend to not believe that it exists. No one ever feels the need to talk about mental health, “it does not exist”, “i never thought you were so weak”, “you are overthinking”, “it’s not like that” are some of the common dialogues which we have to hear. But people need to realize that our brain, which is the most important organ of our body also needs rest, it needs frequent breaks, it needs to be taken care of the most.<br><br>
                      According to a report  in  google,  46%  of  the  people  who commit suicide every year has been suffering mentally and this number is increasng day by day. This phenomenon is occuring worldwide so we cannot limit the consequences to only one country or blame a specific group. It’s a concept which is familiar to all irrespective of age groups but no one is willing to talk about it because of the fear<br><br>
                      Of being shamed or being called a lunatic. However,  even  if  a few people do understand the situation, they will give solutions to seek help or to consult a psychiatrist. But most of the times it does not work because the person going through problems already knows that something is not right with them and they need to go for therapy but they cannot because they either fear what the society will think or they are not ready for it.
 
                    <br><br>
                    The  covid19  pandemic  has  made  it  worse  for  people   who  were already suffering from mental health related issues. Staying cooped up in one house with all the family members for almost a year has not been easy for most people. True, they can be considered lucky as compared to the people fighting the virus but not everyone has a loving or supportive family and that has made matters worse. Domestic violence and sexual harrasment cases has increased tenfold during this period and the ignorance of the society during such cases has not done anything to help. People find it hard to express themselves because they will be considered as vulnerable and weak or in some cases as seeking unnecessary attention. Speaking from personal experience, my aunt’s entire family was infected with the virus and her eldest son also went through mental trauma which resulted in him being hospitalized. My cousin could not understand the situation and commented that she never thought he could be so weak. Just because a person does not show does not mean it is not there, he/she may be suffering internally and the people around him would not have a single clue, he/she could be intending self harm and no one would even know. And when we keep bottling things up, there may come a point when our emotions will be at the peak and we will burst out which may harm us more.
                  <br><br>
                  Our schools and colleges have contributed a lot in encouraging mental health issues. Coming from a ba student who spent her  entire 2nd and 3rd semesters in online classes, this mode of teaching has caused a lot of health related problems (both physical and mental), the latter would not have been a severe case if the teachers would have been more understanding and less dominating or demanding. I have had teachers saying we can go to them if we face any problems, yet at the same time they would not stop spreading negativity, calling us lazy and uncultured and also burdening us with assignments and tests with no regard for our well being. In some cases, i have also seen a few cases where the teacher would ask the student to postpone her medical (blood) test only because she gave a test of 20 marks to be submitted within 45 minutes. All this takes a severe toll on the student. True, in some cases, the teachers may also be suffering but they do need to realize that we are all in this together and we need to help and support each other instead of simply spreading negativity or taking our anger out on people whom we consider to be weaker than us.<br><br>
                  Mental health has no regards for our wealth and power; a person who has everything can also be suffering in silence. We never know the inner battles which people have to fight for themselves and many a times if we get to know about them, we tend to ignore or ask them to stop acting like a kid and grow up. People need to realize that anyone, literally anyone regardless
 
                  Of age, gender, profession, net worth can go through this phrase. The best people can do is to be kind and not spread unnecessary hate. Even if they do not understand what the other person is going through, it is important to ensure that we do not guilt trip the other person into thinking that what they are going through is unusual or cannot be treated. Gaslighting or not letting other people express their opinions freely can also result in mental trauma. In such cases, it is
                  <br><br>
                  Necessary to seek help from  trusted  people.  Therapy  should  be sought by everyone even if they believe that nothing has happened to them, because trust me, everyone is suffering internally and needs help. Also try to be a good listener and always be kind to others; kindness costs nothing.</p>
