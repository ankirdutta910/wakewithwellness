      	<p><span style="color: #000; font-weight: 600">Wake With Wellness</span>  is a community based organization established to
exercise good actions for the rehabilitation of communities regarding
health and social awareness without ascertaining the foundations of
legal norms. We’ll create health awareness campaigns that will include
posters, content creation, interactive sessions and imparting information
that can increase the awareness of people in the country about palliative
and health care. There are five working departments -<br><br><span style="color: #000; font-weight: 600">
* Curation Department<br>
* Public Relations Department<br>
* Publicity & Marketing Department<br>
* Editorial Department<br>
* Design/Media Department<br><br></span>
To improve the attitude of the community about delivery of palliative
and health care services, more sustained efforts are required to make
them believe that palliative and health care can be provided by
community volunteers also and not necessarily only by professionals. Thus the only way to provide palliative and health care to a huge
number of people in need is through community participation. With this
vision of steering people for a hale and hearty life form ,<span style="font-weight: 600;color: #000;"> ‘we are people
caring for people’</span><br> Be a part of this welfare operation by undertaking the pledge to serve people and generations.</p>
